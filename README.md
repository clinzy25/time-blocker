## Issues

- Upper padding of tasks that dont start at the start time of the block. Ie. a 930-1000 task in a 900-1000 cell should fill the _second_ 50% of the block.
- Hovering over cell with expanded task should not show add task btn
- Most inputs need debouncing
- Cant add to last cell

## Todo:

- Mobile view
  - Single column
  - Table controls drop-down menu
  - Task css media query
- A 'work on next week' button that displays the next week. This should evolove into a infinite foreward and backward looking calandar type of thing, where past tasks are permanently stored and visible
- Resize
- Drag and drop
- Accessibility controls

## Lesser todo:

- User can customize colors of cells and columns
- Task Search
- Task tagging

### Beyond

- Google calandar import
